# Creating-an-application-based-on-APEX-technology

Type of work: Individual database project

Summary: This project was carried out independently as a self-initiated effort to deepen my understanding of relational database design and strengthen my experience with Oracle APEX. The work involved creating a complete multi-table relational database with views, user-defined functions, and an interactive user interface. Special attention was given to implementing authentication, access control, and effective data visualization through filtering and charting tools. 

Key skills:

•	Relational database modeling
